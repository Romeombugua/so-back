1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What I'm trying to say is that the appeal is a settlement of some sort.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh, you mean that communication announcement at Internal Lake Storm would be brought into the appeal process?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Right, because they can enter the appeal.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I hope you understand there are issues of reputation, and I have to deal with those in the appeal process rather than the commercial issues around settlement.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And then there's this legal claim for defamation. I believe that the implication would be to proceed with the defamation.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah, I'll investigate to what we have as written evidence of what we do not have.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay, great. I'm thankful for you to do that.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Absolutely. Evidence is important, you know, in order to understand what the party in question has offered the program for this process.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And there is a greater possibility of defamation to everybody in services like this.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Exactly.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I hope you feel that I've been listened to.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah, absolutely. Thank you.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What I've also noted down from this is that there are a number of other people that I needed to speak to, which I'll do as quickly as I possibly can.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It has also raised to this conversation a number of points, which I now need to go back and test from the other perspective to try and make my judgment about working off the evidence side.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I mean strictly because it's a lot of confidential and personal stuff.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And the effect on my team is also something that's sort of there on my mind.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So at the very start of this whole process, I thought it could be dealt with very, very quickly and very, very smoothly.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Or it could just be a traumatic, long drawn out process.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll appreciate that.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The fact that you have, of course, your personal interest and I'm convinced that you have an intention to make this work if at all possible.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And the way it makes sense to the other party too.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So appreciate that.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But the truth is I wouldn't continue to appear if it wasn't, you know, if there wasn't a genuine interest in helping me understand.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, Justin, thank you for struggling so far.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What else would you want to cover?

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Nothing really.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Maybe this is not the right stage for you to talk about the timeline.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Maybe it's going to be quicker than you originally thought.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But I'm not going to worry about any back-filling.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But let me know if we can work out a time at some point.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think I'll go back to Emma and Danny and Bob to understand the evidence we spoke about and how the trading thing got so serious.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Written evidence would be important.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
However, I'll be challenging them with many of the points we've made this conversation.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Alright, sounds cool.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, thank you very much and have a good day.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You too, thank you.
